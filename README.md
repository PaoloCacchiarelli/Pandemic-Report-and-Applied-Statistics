## Pandemic Report: Applied Statistics ##

Purpose and scope:

Advanced statistical studies of various aspects of the pandemic. In this instance, a report was prepared on the fundamental characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as well as an algorithm capable of determining whether populations have been vaccinated or quarantined based on infection curves.

The study analysed the dataset to interpret certain pandemic indicators and took measurements based on infection curves. Statistical methods were applied to analyse data from several countries and draw conclusions.

Interpretation of Infection Curves

In this instance, we conducted a statistical analysis of data to evaluate the effectiveness of public policies implemented by countries in addressing the pandemic.

* Part One: How did the pandemic begin? The first part of the project aims to study the 'exponential growth' phase of the pandemic. The objective is to determine which parameter drives this growth and what factors influence it. Then, the global behaviour of the pandemic was predicted by studying a few well-chosen countries and using established statistical tools.

* Part Two: Evaluating Strategies. This section examines the strategies adopted by states to combat the pandemic, such as vaccination or quarantine, and identifies indicators of the success or failure of these strategies that can be measured on the infection curve. Once the indicators had been selected, information was gathered on countries that had or had not implemented each strategy.

* Part Three: Final Report Preparation. A report was finally prepared, explaining the meaning of the growth parameter and which epidemiological strategies can modify it. The report details why the strategies used in the previous two parts of the work were or were not effective, and includes graphs, histograms, model adjustments and the evolution of infections to support the data processing findings.
